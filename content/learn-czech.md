Title: How to learn Czech

Learning Czech isn't super easy. There are not many people speaking it, and not that many resources to learn it. Here is what I found to be useful.

## The absolute beginning

First, you need to learn the alphabet. It's not that hard, but it's not the same as English. You can find an alright overview of the alphabet [here](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/czech.htm), especially the linked video is useful.

For getting basic vocabulary and a general feel for the language, I recommend using Anki. I made a deck generator that can be used to make a Czech-English (or Czech-German/Spanish/...) deck [here](https://github.com/Vuizur/tatoeba-to-anki).

## Intermediate

For practicing listening, my favourite is the podcast [Čeština s Michalem](https://cesky.buzzsprout.com/). The host has a very clear pronunciation, and it is easy to follow. 

I also recommend practicing reading once you're ready. If you want to read ebooks, I like to use the Czech dictionary integrated in KOReader (which I also created :)).

For practicing writing, I can recommend a chatbot, for example my (of course) bot [here](https://vuizur.github.io/react-gpt3-chatbot/). (Requires an OpenAI key, but creating an account will give you free credits.) You only need to set a Czech prompt in the settings like "Rozhovor mezi mužem a ženou." The bot is not as smart as in other languages, but I think it is still the most intelligent Czech chatbot out there and will only get better as OpenAI improves their models.

## Advanced

I would simply recommend reading more books. And talking to people, either with language exchange sites or https://www.free4talk.com/ (if you are very lucky). Another choice is buying Italki lessons. You can also try a conversation topics generator like [the one here](https://vuizur.github.io/conversation-topics/) and simply hold monologues.

And you should watch movies/Youtube videos/series in Czech. I cannot recommend anything here, because tastes differ, but there is a lot, for example on Netflix.
